# Step 4

Now that the teacher has all of the information they need, they want to be able to message the student with the results.

Complete the `studentMsg` function with `totalScores` and `studentScore` for parameters. The function should return a string representing a message to the student.

If the student passed the course, the string should follow this format:

Example Code

```shell
Class average: average-goes-here. Your grade: grade-goes-here. You passed the course.
If the student failed the course, the string should follow this format:
```

Example Code

```shell
Class average: average-goes-here. Your grade: grade-goes-here. You failed the course.
Replace average-goes-here with the average of the total scores. Replace grade-goes-here with the student's grade.
```

# Tips

- Use the getAverage function to get the class average.
- Use the getGrade function to get the student's grade.
- Use string concatenation (+) to build the message.
- Be careful with the punctuation and spaces in the message.
