# Step 2

Now the teacher needs your help converting the student score to a letter grade.

Complete the `getGrade` function that takes a number `score` as a parameter. Your function should return a string representing a letter grade based on the score.

Here are the scores and their corresponding letter grades:

| Score Range | Letter Grade |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 100         | "A++"        |
| 90 - 99     | "A"          |
| 80 - 89     | "B"          |
| 70 - 79     | "C"          |
| 60 - 69     | "D"          |
| 0 - 59      | "F"          |

# Tips:

- Use conditional statements: if, else if, and else.
- Use comparison operators: >, <, >=, <=, ===.
- You might also find the logical AND operator && useful.
